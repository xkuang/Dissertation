MSc in Applied Statistics python code: Predict intensity conflict in human interactions in real world videos. Capture the generative process 
and the human dynamics using a variational autoencoder. Fit an LSTM to capture the time dependency of the video frames and predict the
conflict intensity labels using a fully connected MLP.
